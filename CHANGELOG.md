## [Unreleased]

### Phase 7 — Data Durability & Secret Hygiene (2026-06-10)

#### Fixed
- **Data loss guard on `002_finance_upgrade.sql` (§4)** — inserted a `DO $$ … RAISE EXCEPTION` block immediately before the `DROP TABLE` cascade. If `transactions` already exists and contains rows the migration aborts loudly with a row count and a pointer to the runbook, so an accidental re-run (cleared `schema_migrations`, manual invocation, partial restore) cannot wipe the ledger. Fresh installs pass through (`to_regclass` returns `NULL` when the table is absent). Intentional resets still work via `TRUNCATE transactions` first.
- **Single-host backup risk (§6)** — extended the `db_backup` sidecar to optionally push each nightly dump to S3 / Cloudflare R2 after writing it locally. Conditional on `BACKUP_S3_BUCKET`; with that var absent behaviour is identical to before (local-only). `--endpoint-url` makes it work against R2 as well as AWS S3. Five new optional `BACKUP_S3_*` vars documented in `.env.docker.example`.
- **Dev secrets treated as compromised (§8)** — added explicit "generate fresh, never reuse dev" warnings to both `.env.docker.example` and `server/.env.example`; extended `docs/RUNBOOK.md §3` with the exact `openssl rand` commands and the rule that the dev `SESSION_SECRET`/DB password must never be promoted to production.

#### Added
- **`docs/RUNBOOK.md §1a`** — "Off-host backups & monthly restore drill": how to verify both local and off-host copies, and a step-by-step monthly restore procedure against a throwaway Postgres container.

### Phase 6 — Rate-Limit Self-Lockout Fix (2026-06-10)

#### Fixed
- **Critical: `/api/auth/me` self-lockout (§3-N1)** — `GET /api/auth/me` and `POST /api/auth/logout` were mounted behind `authLimiter` (5 req / 15 min / IP) along with `login` and `register`. Because `useAuth()` calls `/me` on every protected-route mount, six page loads / refreshes / open tabs in 15 minutes triggered a `429` self-lockout. Fix: `authLimiter` is now applied only to `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/register` via path-specific `app.use` mounts registered before the router; the router itself runs under `generalLimiter` (100/min), so `/me` and `/logout` are no longer counted against the credential-guessing budget.
- **Critical: `429` cascade to `/login` (§5/§8/§9)** — a `429` from the axios interceptor previously fell through to the generic error path, which caused `useAuth` to return `user: null` and `AuthGuard` to redirect to `/login` — which is on the same exhausted limiter, deepening the lockout. Fix: the interceptor now has an explicit `429` branch that surfaces the server's "slow down" message without redirecting; the rejected `Error` carries `err.status`; `useAuth` exposes a `throttled` flag (`error?.status === 429`); `AuthGuard` shows the loading skeleton (not a redirect) when `throttled` is true.

### Phase 5 — Documentation, Observability & Future-Proofing (2026-06-10)

#### Added
- **Sentry error reporting** — `@sentry/node` on the server (captures unhandled exceptions; attaches `reqId` tag; gated on `SENTRY_DSN` env var); `@sentry/react` on the client (initializes before render; composed with the existing `ErrorBoundary`; gated on `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`).
- **OpenAPI 3.1 spec** — `server/scripts/generate-openapi.js` uses `@asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi` to derive a spec from existing Zod schemas; `npm run openapi` (from `server/`) writes to `docs/openapi.json`.
- **`docs/RUNBOOK.md`** — DB backup/restore (`pg_dump` / `pg_restore`), migration rollback procedure, `SESSION_SECRET` rotation, object storage migration plan (disk → Cloudflare R2), and common incident runbooks.
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — Durable architecture reference: stack, data flow, full route map, complete DB schema table, middleware stack order, and design decisions (API versioning, session vs JWT, attachment storage). Includes the `user_settings` table plan and the API versioning decision.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`**, **`SECURITY.md`**, **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — standard project meta-files.
- `SENTRY_DSN` / `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` documented in all three `.env*.example` files.

#### Changed
- `PROJECT_STATE.md` — added pointer to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/RUNBOOK.md`; living status content retained.

### Phase 4 — Operational Hardening (2026-06-09)

- `bcrypt` → `bcryptjs` (pure JS; eliminates `tar`/`node-pre-gyp` high-severity transitive vulns).
- CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): parallel server + client jobs; `npm audit --audit-level=high`; lint; build; test.
- Structured logging: `server/lib/logger.js` (pino); `pino-http` assigns `req.id`; `errorHandler` echoes `reqId` in responses.
- Docker healthchecks for `api` and `nginx` containers; nginx `depends_on: service_healthy`.
- Nginx security + cache headers in `client/nginx.docker.conf`.
- `db_backup` sidecar: daily `pg_dump` → `postgres_backups` named volume.

---

### Phase 3 — Data Integrity & Resilience (2026-06-09)

- Named Docker volume `uploads_data` — attachments survive `docker compose up --build`.
- Graceful shutdown — `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` drain HTTP connections → pg pool → exit 0; 10 s force-exit fallback.
- Auto-run migrations on deploy (`migrate.js && index.js`); advisory lock prevents race on rolling deploys.
- React `ErrorBoundary` wraps `<App />` — render crashes show `ErrorState` instead of white screen.
- Email lowercase normalization on register; pg `23505` → `409 CONFLICT` in error handler.
- Migration `005_idempotency_guards.sql`: `CHECK (amount <> 0)` + partial UNIQUE index on Transfer rows.

---

### Phase 2 — Security Hardening (2026-06-10)

- `express-rate-limit` (`authLimiter` 5/15 min; `generalLimiter` 100/min).
- `helmet` (CSP, HSTS in prod, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy).
- Authenticated attachment downloads — removed public `/uploads/` static mount; new `GET /api/research/attachments/:id/download` route (auth + ownership).
- `rehype-sanitize` applied to markdown editor live preview and `MarkdownPreview`.
- `crypto.randomUUID()` filenames for uploads (replaces `Date.now()`-based names).

---

### Phase 1 — Research Upgrade (2026-06-02)

- Migration `004_research_topics.sql`: `research_topics`, `research_entry_topics` pivot, `research_attachments`, `research_entries.is_pinned`.
- Full-text search, tag filters, date-range filter, topic sidebar, bulk actions (archive/delete), entry detail modal, export (JSON/CSV), pin/duplicate/copy-citation controls.

---

### Initial Deployment (2026-06-01)

- Docker + Docker Compose (nginx → api → db), manual Nginx + PM2 configs, Cloudflare Tunnel.
- README rewritten in English.

---

### Audit & Foundation (2026-05-31)

- Full audit/hardening pass: created missing `components/ui/*`, hooks (`useApi`, `useTheme`, `useToast`), `server/lib/*`, `errorHandler`, `validate` middleware.
- Fixed broken config: `index.css` Tailwind directives, `index.html` Inter font, `postcss.config.js`, Vite port/proxy, missing client/server deps.
- Corrected bugs: router named-export mismatch, Dashboard stat-key mismatches, duplicate `AppLayout.jsx`.
- Added `express.json({ limit: '1mb' })`, session `sameSite: 'lax'`, pg pool sizing.
